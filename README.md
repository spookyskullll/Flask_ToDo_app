I created a simple Flask-based to-do app that uses HTML and SQLite for the frontend and Flask with Python for the backend. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, making task management easy and efficient. The frontend is built using HTML and basic CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface. The backend, powered by Flask, handles requests and interacts with an SQLite database to store tasks. Each task is stored with a title, status, and unique ID, allowing for easy retrieval and updates. The app follows a minimalistic approach, keeping things lightweight and efficient while demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. By integrating Flask with SQLite, I ensured that the data persists across sessions, making it a practical solution for personal task management.
